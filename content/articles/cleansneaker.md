# Creating a specialized experience for sneakerheads

## Outcome

Sneakerheads now have a specialised experience while shopping for shoes, giving them a new first choice destination for their needs.

### Making shoe enthusiasts go online again

The application is targetted to users in the ages between **18 - 55**, preferably those involed in **creative fields** with a **high Purchasing power**.
The intent was to cultivate a culture of footwear as a lifestyle than just a commodity, by providing a premium experience.

## My Role in the project

This was part of my design bootcamp, and I was involved in each phase of the project. The research part was conducted by a team of 3, while we completed the visual designs individually.

## Constraints

### The Challenge: Start to finish in 14 weeks

The duration of bootcamp was 14 weeks, during the course of which we would not only learn the concept of research and design, but we were also expected to complete an entire project (start to finish) during this time.

## The Process

### Discover Phase

We initial phase was mostly spent in gathering information.
We started off with a **stakeholder interview**, to get a deeper understanding of the expecations. Using this information, we were able to formulate a **design strategy**.
We also sat down with a few users and conducted **interviews**, to gain deeper insight into their needs and their current shopping patterns.
We learnt the following points through this exercise:

1. Lack of trust in sizes shown online v/s real life.
2. Photos can be misleading, never look as desirable in real life.
3. Lack of proper categorization compared to mainstream shopping apps.
4. Amount of choices can be overwhelming.

For more quantitative results, we also conducted online surveys to cater to a larger audience. Here's what we found:

### Describe Phase

The next phase involved taking up all the information we had previously obtained, and trying to make sense of it.

We started off, by creating a **persona** to represent our user, using a lot of data from the previous interviews and survey.

Next, we created an **empathy map** in order to step into the user's shoes, and gain a deeper understanding of their pains.

And finally, we created the **user journey map**, to better illustrate the user's activities, and to identify the key interactions and touchpoints with our product, taking into consideration their goals, motivations and feelings at each step.

### Ideate Phase

Now that we had some structure about the user and their needs, we created the **user flow**. This would show us the multiple routes that could be taken by a user interacting with the app, and to predict and show their behavior.

Next, we conducted a **card sorting** exercise. This would help us unserstand the user's mental model, and learn how they would categorize products when left to it on their own.

We ticked off the ideation phase by creating the **information architecture** document. This is the last step of research, where we documented our final learnings.

Post this phase, the teams were split up and we were left on our own to work on the visual designs.

### Design Phase

Using the IA document, we created some low **fidelity wireframes** for the product, initially on paper and then digitally.

Using the **material design** guidelines for Android and the Human **interface guidelines** for iOS, the wiereframes were transformed into high fidelity.

And the final step was to complete the designs, and here are the final screens:

### Usability

The last phase of the project was **usability testing**.
We took our final design mockups to multiple users and monitored how they would interact with it, and getting their feedback. Here are some of the learnings:

1. The application looks clean and premium.
2. The try and buy feature needs to be shown with more emphasis.
3. There needs to be a difference between a wishlist and favourites if they need both.
4. Homepage needs to show all the content headers, which are otherwise hidden below the recommendation section.
5. The product card can show more info at a glance (authenticity, available colours, try before you buy availability).
